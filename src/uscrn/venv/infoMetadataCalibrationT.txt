For curves -> fields to select:
Temperature Sensor -> Calibration Formula
Datalogger -> Model


For coeffs -> fields to select:
Temperature Sensor -> C0 C1 C2 C3

Be careful!
1) Only a few stations have the coefficient c3. When you merge the 3 csv files, make sure that the columns are aligned correctly.
2) delete null values (e.g. station 1041 NH Durham 2 N has them)
3) remove all scientific notation
